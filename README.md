# Data-Science-Project-2
The Sonoma Animal Shelter is an animal hospital and shelter in Sonoma California that is responsible for over 4000 rescues and adoptions per year. We will be analyzing and comparing data of the Sonoma Animal Shelter collected by the Sonoma Department of Health Services in February, 2017.

Within this data set, we will be specifically looking at the qualities of dogs and cats that have the highest chance to be adopted, and which of them get returned to their owners the most.

This data set was gathered by the county of Sonoma Department of Health Services. We will be looking at what are the main factors of a pet being adopted or returned to their owner. Some of these factors include but are not limited to: Sex, Breed, Size, and Age.
